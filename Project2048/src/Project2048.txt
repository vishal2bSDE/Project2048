Problem Statement
Let's look at a game named '2048'. The game has a 4x4 board that looks something like this:


Image Source: This and all subsequent images are from the website play2048.co

The game starts with one or more random tiles at random positions. The above image is a valid starting point.

According to play2048.co:

Join the tiles, get to 2048!
HOW TO PLAY: Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch. Add them up to reach 2048!
Rules of the game
All the tiles on the board will be a power of 2 like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128,...., 2048.
There are 4 possible moves: left, right, top, bottom.
On each move, all the tiles slide in the direction of the move until they are stopped by another tile or an edge.
A random tile will be inserted at a random empty spot on the board after every move.
If after sliding, two tiles with the same values collide in the direction of the slide then they will merge into a tile with the value being the total of the collided tiles.
Example: Two tiles numbered 4 will merge to form a tile numbered 8. The merging will happen in the direction of the movement.
A merged tile will not merge with another tile in the same move.
In case 3 consecutive tiles have the same number then the farther tile in the direction of the move will merge. In case all four tiles have the same number then the first two and last two will merge.
The game is won if the board has a tile numbered 2048.
The game is lost if there are no possible moves left: No empty tile and no adjacent tiles with the same number.
Try out the game here for further clarification. Do not try to complete the game as it is highly addictive.
